# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
The user's high-level objective is to implement and enhance a web application for tracking products on Wildberries and Ozon marketplaces with unified matching of identical products and display of overall statistics, including a fully functional admin panel with visual stability.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: Go (Gin framework), React, PostgreSQL, Docker
- **Architecture**: Microservice architecture with separate frontend and backend containers
- **Security**: JWT tokens with 12-hour validity, bcrypt for passwords, AES for API token encryption
- **Internationalization**: Support for Russian and English languages via i18next
- **Theming**: Light and dark theme support with user preference persistence
- **Admin Panel**: Statistics, filters, sorting, export, charts
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit for centralized authentication and UI state
- **Optimization**: Lazy loading, pagination, list virtualization
- **API Versioning**: Implementation with versioned routes /api/v1/
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling system
- **Charts**: Recharts library for data visualization
- **Testing**: Unit tests for core services

## Recent Actions
